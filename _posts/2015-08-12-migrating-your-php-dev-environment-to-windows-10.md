If you've been reading our blog, you might remember me posting about <a href="/blog/2015/06/02/avalara-php-windows">using our PHP samples for AvaTax</a> with PHP and Windows.

Once my personal machines were upgraded to Windows 10 (still waiting for corporate IT on the work machine), I decided to test the environment I'd previously set up on a Windows 7 machine. I used my backed-up installation of PHP 5.6.3, made sure I'd <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/">added the PHP directory location to my machine's path</a>, and ran the ping test.

Went off without a hitch. To be honest, I didn't expect anything different. But with a new OS upgrade, you never know where you'll run into compatibility issues, so it's always worth testing.

There's a <a href="https://github.com/avadev/AvaTax-Calc-REST-JavaScript">new sample</a> posted for folks working in JavaScript! This sample uses a server-side PHP proxy to call the service, making it easier to calculate accurate taxes and record documents from browser checkout environments. Check it out and let us know what you think!

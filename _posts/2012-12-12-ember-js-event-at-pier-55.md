Avalara has been using Ember.js for six months now so we were proud to host the inaugural <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Seattle-Meetup/">Seattle Ember.js Meetup</a> last Thursday. In a meeting that tested the capacity of our new space on the water at Pier 55 in downtown Seattle we were honored to host Yehuda Katz and Tom Dale from the core Ember.js team in a presentation that lasted two hours. In Avalara tradition we rolled out the margarita machine for the participants and the conversations with the presenters lasted well into the night.

Yehuda and Tom delivered a wealth of information about the upcoming functionality in Ember and Ember-data and we've uploaded the talks and Q&amp;A sessions to YouTube for all to enjoy.<!--more-->

We hope to host more events like this in our new space. In the meantime, if you're an Ember developer that wants to deliver some big products that will be used by a lot of people, let us know.

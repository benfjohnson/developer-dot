<strong> <a ref="//www.slideshare.net/lokeuei/how-to-build-a-successful-api-certification-program-integrate-2015">How to Build a Successful API Certification Program - Integrate 2015</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="//www.slideshare.net/lokeuei">Loke Tan</a></strong>

A few weeks ago I had the honor of speaking at two developer conferences that were held in California. The first was <a href="http://integratecon.com">Integrate 2015</a> which is also part of the <a href="http://apiworld.co">API World </a>series of events. My talk was titled "How to build a successful API Certification Program" and it details all the learnings and experience we've gone through building and operating our own Certification Program here at Avalara.

<strong> <a href="//www.slideshare.net/lokeuei/the-wacky-world-of-sales-tax-findevr-2015">The Wacky World of Sales Tax - FinDEVr 2015</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="//www.slideshare.net/lokeuei">Loke Tan</a></strong>

The second talk was at the Financial Developers event called <a href="http://findevr.com">FinDEVr</a> where over 500 financial developers &amp; business development attendees met to share ideas about their financial related technologies. My talk was titled "The Wacky World of Sales Tax" and it was a whimsical look at the complex business of Sales Tax and how developer can benefit from working with Avalara's API.

Both the presentations are available on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lokeuei">Slideshare</a>.

Enjoy!

If including tax calculation and remittance capabilities into your application has been both daunting and tiresome, and therefore easy to put on the back burner, we understand.  Your users need this capability to keep the tax auditors at bay, but you don't have time to wade through pages of documentation to try to understand the complexities of sales and use tax.  We want to help you deliver that huge operational efficiency and tax protection to your users quickly and easily. 

Introducing the <a href="/avatax/dev-guide/">AvaTax Developer Guide</a>.  We have condensed and simplified our documentation into a fun-to-read chapter format to help you easily and successfully build your integration to AvaTax. 

<h3>Quick Integration</h3>
In each chapter, we cover everything from how to obtain your <a href="/avatax/signup/">free sandbox account</a> to why your users should care about <a href="/avatax/dev-guide/consumer-use-tax/">Consumer Use Tax</a>.  You can easily navigate around the different areas of interest and return to them as needed.

<ul class="normal">
    <li>Learn about how Avalara uses logic around specific <a href="/avatax/dev-guide/product-taxability/">product taxability</a> to deliver the most accurate tax rate for that product. </li>
    <li>Should your users report <a href="/avatax/dev-guide/shipping-and-handling/">shipping and handling charges</a>?</li>
    <li>How can you ensure that your application can still calculate tax when you've lost connection to the internet?  We have the best practices for <a href="/avatax/dev-guide/calculating-tax-offline/">calcluating tax offline</a>.</li>
</ul>

The book will help direct you to the correct <a href="https://developer.avalara.com/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/">API reference</a> page for each function, so you can work at your own pace.  Each chapter even includes test cases you can use to check if your software is working correctly!

<h3>Connector Developers</h3>

For developers working on integrating AvaTax into accounting systems or web storefronts, we have a list of <a href="/certification/avatax/use-tax/">certification requirements</a> you should consider if you wish to apply for Avalara Certified Connector status.  It's a great way to learn the theory of tax and how it applies to your software!

The <a href="/avatax/dev-guide/getting-started-with-avatax/">AvaTax Developer Guide</a> teaches you everything you need to know to create a robust integration for all types of customers.  Quickstart chapters will help you get started fast, customization chapters will help you map your accounting system's features to AvaTax, and the advanced chapters will help you ensure compatibility with large enterprises when they begin using your software.  If you've ever wondered why some large enterprises use <a href="/avatax/dev-guide/locations/">location-based reporting</a>, we've got you covered.

Please come and see what is new.  As always, we welcome your feedback on our new format and how it can be improved.  Relax, we'll handle the tax.

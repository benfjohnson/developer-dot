Some long-awaited additional parameters have been added to the tax/get POST request with the recent 13.3 release. These parameters are now available on both development and production for all clients using the REST API. With this update, the REST API is now in full best-practice parity with our SOAP API. For more information, see the <a href="/api-reference/avatax/rest/v1">tax/get POST documentation.</a>

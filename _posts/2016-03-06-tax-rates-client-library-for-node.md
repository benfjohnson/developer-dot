The Avalara Developer Relations team is boldly going (cue music) into node.js. We released our first node.js helper library in August for the <a href="http://www.taxrates.com">TaxRates.com</a> API. This is our <i>free</i> and simple API for getting sales tax rates and authorities based on a street address or zip/postal code in the U.S. or Canada. The new node.js library makes it easy to integrate it into your node-based projects.

You can find sample code in the readme of the <a href="https://github.com/YiddishNinja/TaxRates-node">TaxRates-node Github repository</a>. You can also embed it in your node.js project: <code style="background-color: #e6e6e6; font-family: courier; font-size: 12px;">npm install avalara-taxrates</code>.

I cannot give a definitive statement on when our next node.js library is coming, but things are in the works.

If you're going to be at the <a href="http://integratecon.com/hackathon/">Integrate Hackathon</a> later this month, look for me. I'll be wearing an Avalara t-shirt and I just might have some swag to distribute (like our <a href="/public/images/blog/sticker.jpg">"Dev &amp; Taxes" sugar skull sticker</a>).

Once the conference starts, watch for the ever-popular and ever-ebullient Loke-Uei Tan to join us as a conference attendee and <i><a href="http://integrate2015.sched.org/speaker/lokeuei.tan?iframe=no#.VfLrRRF3mUM">conference speaker</a></i>.

Loke, Anya, and I will also be working the Avalara presence at <a href="http://sanfran2015.findevr.com/">FinDevR</a> in San Francisco next month, so if you're going to be at that event, make sure to stop by our table and say hello.

I'm using my blog post this month to start a conversation. I'm beginning work on an NPM module to simplify the AvaTax REST interface for node.js. This leaves me with two questions I'd like to pose:
<ul class="normal">
	<li>Have any of you tried implementing this in node.js already. What were your experiences?</li>
	<li>Are there other languages or frameworks you'd like us to develop samples/libraries for to help power your development?</li>
</ul>
If you haven't tried <a href="https://community.avalara.com/avalara/category_sets/developers">our developer community</a>, this is the perfect time to start. <a href="https://community.avalara.com/avalara/topics/node-js-and-other-languages">Join the discussion on this topic</a> in our community.

I'm off-site, speaking at the CascadiaJS conference and getting my JavaScript geek on, but I'll try to check in and respond to comments a few times this week. Looking forward to your feedback.

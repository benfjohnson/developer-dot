This week I had the great pleasure of talking at <a href="http://defragcon.com/">DefragCon 2015</a>. I talked about the technological and political implications around using API descriptions to build a Developer Portal. This is something we've been working through here at Avalara - how to minimize the delay between updates to the service and updates to our site? How do we know that everything is correct forever with no manual work???

If this is something that interests you, reach out or take a look at my slides!

If you're going to be in Austin for <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">APIStrat</a>Â next week, I'll be talking about this some more!

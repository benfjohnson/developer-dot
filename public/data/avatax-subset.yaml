  description: "The legacy AvaTax REST 1.0 API documentation is available online for users who have existing implementations of AvaTax built using REST 1.0.  New integrations should use the full [AvaTax REST 2.0 API](/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/), which fully replaces REST 1.0.
  
  The [SOAP API reference](/avatax/api-reference/tax/soap/) is also available.
  
  A full set of sample requests is available as a [Postman collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/e362821310b01d7580e9)."
